score = 6

# This is the basic way of writing an if/else
# if score > 5:
#     result = 'Pass'
# else:
#     result = 'Fail'

# Another option, is ternary code:

result = 'pass' if score > 5 else 'fail'

# This does the same thing, but the code is passed into the variable
# This is part of the foundation of python. Something that reads easily. Anyone 'could' read that and guess what it does
# This is not necessary. It's good practice, and looks neater, but both are correct. Do the other one till comfortable with this
