Karaoke venues usually have an entry fee - So the guests could have money so they can pay it.
    * Guest Class - Wallet balance, and all subsequent tests changed - DONE
    * Room Class - Needs to have a cost associated with it. Do a flat rate for now
    * Bar Class - Asks to deduct Guest balance, but the guest themselves must do it - 2ND PART DONE
    * Bar Class - Then takes the money
    * Bar Class - Has a till/register



Advanced extensions:
Guests could have a favourite song, and if their favourite song is on the room's playlist, they can cheer loudly! (return a string like "Whoo!")
Rooms can keep track of the entry fees/spending of the guests - maybe add a bar tab/bar class?
Add anything extra you think would be good to have at a karaoke venue!
